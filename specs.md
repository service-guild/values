# Crafting Your Values - Specifications

## Overview
The "Crafting Your Values" exercise is designed to help you identify and refine what truly matters in your life. It guides you through a process of sorting, narrowing down, and articulating your core values. The exercise consists of four main parts and includes a comprehensive list of value cards.

## Part 1: So What's Actually Important to You (and What Isn't)
- **Objective:**  
  Begin by categorizing all provided values based on their personal significance.

- **Setup:**
  - Use a set of value cards (printed or digital).
  - Prepare three columns titled:
    - **"Very important to me"**
    - **"Important to me"**
    - **"Not important to me"**

- **Instructions:**
  - Place each value card into one of the three columns based on your immediate, gut reaction.
  - Do not overthink the placement; trust your feelings.
  - Review and adjust the placements until the columns accurately represent your priorities.

## Part 2: Narrowing Down
- **Objective:**  
  Refine the selection by focusing on values that you initially rated as "Very important to me."

- **Instructions:**
  - Set aside the values in the "Not important to me" and "Important to me" columns.
  - Re-create three columns using only the values from the previous **"Very important to me"** category:
    - **"Very important to me"**
    - **"Important to me"**
    - **"Not important to me"**
  - Sort the remaining values again, comparing their relative importance.
  - Adjust the order until you feel that the columns accurately reflect your priorities.

- **Outcome:**
  - If you end up with 5 or fewer values in the **"Very important to me"** column, you may skip the next step.
  - Otherwise, proceed to Part 3 for further refinement.

## Part 3: The Most Important Stuff
- **Objective:**  
  Identify your top core values from the refined list.

- **Instructions:**
  - From the values sorted in Part 2, create two new columns:
    - **"Very important to me"** (suggested label: **"F*CK YEAH"** – your must-haves)
    - **"Also something I want in my life"** (suggested label: **"THIS IS AWESOME TOO"**)
  - **Rule:** The **"F*CK YEAH"** column can contain a maximum of **5 values**.
  - Finalize the selection by ensuring that only 5 values occupy the **"F*CK YEAH"** column.

- **Additional Task:**
  - For each of your 5 core values, write a personalized statement in the following format:
    - *I want [description of your core value]*  
      _(Example: "I want to accept myself as I am (self-acceptance)")_

## Part 4: Your Core Values (Reference/Visualization)
- **Objective:**  
  Provide a visual summary of your final values.

- **Instructions:**
  - Review a sample grid or template displaying categories such as:
    - **Personal Values**
    - **Important To Me**
    - **Very Important To Me**
    - **Not Important To Me**
  - Use this grid as a reference to ensure that your selections accurately represent your priorities.
  - This part may be provided as a printed template or a visual guide and serves as a confirmation of your finalized core values.

- **Iterative Process:**  
  You may move value cards multiple times as your understanding and priorities evolve.

- **Reflection:**  
  Use the exercise as an opportunity for deep self-reflection to better understand what truly matters in your life.
